# Bestie

_Bestie_ is an app which sends you email reminders about your friends’ birthdays.

It’s compatible with any device. The style of the app was inspired by my love of sweets and all things kawaii.

To get back to your page click on **the Bestie logo**. Each of your friends will get their own circle. If you're using a mobile device and you want to delete a friend, tap on the circle and click delete. If you’re using a laptop, hover over a friend and click delete.
