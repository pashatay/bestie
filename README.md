# Bestie

_Bestie_ is an app which can send you email reminders about your friends birtdays.

It works well on any device. The style of the app is a result of my insperation by birthday cakes and sweets.

In order to start using **the Best!e App** you need to sign up for an account first.
As soon as you sign up, the App will email you a verification link.

Click the link and you're all set! Now, you can start using the app.
After login, you will be redirected to your main page, where you can find "add-friend" button.  
Go ahead and add your first friends info:

- First name;

To get back to your page click on **Best!e** logo. Each friend of yours will get its own circle. If you want to delete a friend tap on the circle and click delete (if you're using mobile device) or hover over a friend and click delete (from laptop).
