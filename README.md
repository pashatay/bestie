_Bestie_ is an app which can send you email reminders about your friends birthdays.

It works well on any device. The style of the app is a result of my inspiration by birthday cakes and sweets.

In order to start using **the Best!e App** you need to sign up for an account first.
As soon as you sign up, **Bestie** will email you a verification link.

Click the link and you're all set! Now, you can start using the app.
After login, you will be redirected to your main page, where you can find the **"add-friend"** button.  
Go ahead and add your first friends info:

- First name;
- Last name:
- Relationship:
- and the date of birth of course!

To get back to your page click on **Best!e** logo. Each friend of yours will get its own circle. If you want to delete a friend, tap on the circle and click delete (if you're using mobile device) or hover over a friend and click delete (if you're using a laptop).

When one of your friends will have a _birthday_, **Bestie** will email you a reminder.

Make sure, you will keep **Bestie** updated if your email change!
You can update your email or password by clicking on **"edit account"** button from the main page.

For each email update **Bestie** will email you a verification link to make sure we got it right. So, you won't miss any birthday reminders!

If you will ever feel _dramatic_ and would like to delete your account, you can do so by clicking **"delete account"** button from the main page.

Before deleting your info **Bestie** would like to be sure you thought twice.
If you will press **"Yes"**, your data will be erased permanently.
